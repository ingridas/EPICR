Description: It implements the Efficient Pareto Iterative Classification
    (EPIC) method for costly black-box multiobjective optimization problems which
    approximates the Pareto optimal set with a limited number of objective function
    evaluations. It also comes with an enhanced EPIC version using a local search to
    explore a promising area locally by Nelder-Mead simplex method.
