Description: Multiobjective optimization using the Efficient Pareto Iterative Classification (EPIC) method for costly black-box multiobjective optimization problems which approximates the Pareto optimal set with a limited number of objective function evaluations. It also comes with an enhanced EPIC version using a local search to explore a promising area locally by Nelder-Mead simplex method.
